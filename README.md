# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
In this election audit, a Colorado Board of Elections employee tasked me to provide an analysis of a recent local congressional election to calculate:

1. List of counties that voted.
2. Tally of all votes per county.
3. The percentage of the total votes per county.
4. Determine the county with the largest number of voters.

## Election Audit Results
The results of my analysis can be found through this [link] (https://github.com/legeren/Election_Analysis/blob/4d3ae4b5441667183d84945db412de6301eb9905/analysis/election_analysis.txt).

In summary:
- **369,711** votes were cast in this congressional election.
- The breakdown per county are as follows:
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
- **Denver** had the largest number of votes at 306,055.
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- The winner of the election was **Diana DeGette** who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary
This script is versatile enough to be reused in other elections.  Below are a couple of examples where simple modifications can be made to the code.

1. State governor election: exchange **county** for **state** in the code and making sure your code is picking up from the correct column in your source file
```
# 2: Track the largest county and county voter turnout.
largest_county_turnout = ""
largest_county_count = 0
winningcounty_count = 0
winningcounty_perc = 0

# Read the csv and convert it into a list of dictionaries
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:
    reader = csv.reader(election_data)

    # Read the header
    header = next(reader)

    # For each row in the CSV file.
    for row in reader:

        # Add to the total vote count
        total_votes = total_votes + 1

        # Get the candidate name from each row.
        candidate_name = row[2]

        # 3: Extract the county name from each row.
        county_name = row[1]

        # If the candidate does not match any existing candidate add it to
        # the candidate list
        if candidate_name not in candidate_options:

            # Add the candidate name to the candidate list.
            candidate_options.append(candidate_name)

            # And begin tracking that candidate's voter count.
            candidate_votes[candidate_name] = 0

        # Add a vote to that candidate's count
        candidate_votes[candidate_name] += 1

        # 4a: Write an if statement that checks that the
        # county does not match any existing county in the county list.
        if county_name not in county_list:

            # 4b: Add the existing county to the list of counties.
            county_list.append(county_name)

            # 4c: Begin tracking the county's vote count.
            county_votes[county_name] = 0

        # 5: Add a vote to that county's vote count.
        county_votes[county_name] +=1


# Save the results to our text file.
with open(file_to_save, "w") as txt_file:

    # Print the final vote count (to terminal)
    election_results = (
        f"\nElection Results\n"
        f"-------------------------\n"
        f"Total Votes: {total_votes:,}\n"
        f"-------------------------\n\n"
        f"County Votes:\n")
    print(election_results, end="")

    txt_file.write(election_results)
```

2. Municipal election: exchange **county** for **ward** in the code and making sure your code is picking up from the correct column in your source file
```
# 2: Track the largest county and county voter turnout.
largest_county_turnout = ""
largest_county_count = 0
winningcounty_count = 0
winningcounty_perc = 0

# Read the csv and convert it into a list of dictionaries
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:
    reader = csv.reader(election_data)

    # Read the header
    header = next(reader)

    # For each row in the CSV file.
    for row in reader:

        # Add to the total vote count
        total_votes = total_votes + 1

        # Get the candidate name from each row.
        candidate_name = row[2]

        # 3: Extract the county name from each row.
        county_name = row[1]

        # If the candidate does not match any existing candidate add it to
        # the candidate list
        if candidate_name not in candidate_options:

            # Add the candidate name to the candidate list.
            candidate_options.append(candidate_name)

            # And begin tracking that candidate's voter count.
            candidate_votes[candidate_name] = 0

        # Add a vote to that candidate's count
        candidate_votes[candidate_name] += 1

        # 4a: Write an if statement that checks that the
        # county does not match any existing county in the county list.
        if county_name not in county_list:

            # 4b: Add the existing county to the list of counties.
            county_list.append(county_name)

            # 4c: Begin tracking the county's vote count.
            county_votes[county_name] = 0

        # 5: Add a vote to that county's vote count.
        county_votes[county_name] +=1


# Save the results to our text file.
with open(file_to_save, "w") as txt_file:

    # Print the final vote count (to terminal)
    election_results = (
        f"\nElection Results\n"
        f"-------------------------\n"
        f"Total Votes: {total_votes:,}\n"
        f"-------------------------\n\n"
        f"County Votes:\n")
    print(election_results, end="")

    txt_file.write(election_results)
```
